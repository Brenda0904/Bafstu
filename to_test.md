Variant Calling
==
DeepSVR
====

Installed --> Fix some errors

VCF-Annotation
==
CHASM
====

Need to create hg38 data.

Needs a mysql database.

Look into the paper more to decide if it is worth the difficulty of installation.

FATHMM-XF
====
Installed --> Need to test

DeepSEA
====

Install this one

CADD
====

Tested --> functional

Protein Function Analysis
==

Envision
====

Need Uniprot ids --> lot of the uniprot ids not in the tool.

Look into the meaning of the score

See where the most recent protein function information is stored/ how it is updated. --> Uniprot

~0 (most damaging) to ~1 (most wild-type-like)

Look into the calculation of new scores.
Check the difference of the list w/ swissprot ids and the output vcf.


EVmutation --> Replaced with EVcouplings (python package)
====

Look into the meaning of the score

See where the most recent protein function information is stored/ how it is updated. --> Uniprot

Variant Filtering
==

Exomiser
====

Installed --> works on data supplied by paper
Installed --> Run it using HPO ids.

Check whether to run it online or offline.
What information is stored to match the HPO ids to the genes.

SomaticSeq
====

Maybe look into it later, because it is for somatic variants and is a merging tool
